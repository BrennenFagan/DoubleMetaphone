Hello reader! Please do not be alarmed if any files (especially the readme) change. This is a first in some ways for myself.

This application is for a customization of Double Metaphone. My team and I found out about this algorithm via search,
and decided to implement a variation for it for word filtering. Another search later and we discovered the following source:
https://github.com/android/platform_external_apache-http/blob/master/src/org/apache/commons/codec/language/DoubleMetaphone.java
This source, retrieved February 7th, 2016, comes with the following notice, reproduced here.

Please do note that, aside from the wrapper (MainActivity) and the change in imports, the initial commit represents the 
original code.
Modification after that is under the ownership of myself (and/or whomever of my team works on it) and can be viewed via the 
commit history on Github at:
https://github.com/BrennenFagan/DoubleMetaphone

A large amount of the code has changed in some ways since the original prospect. Feel free to take a look through. The
procedure for modifying this code is actually test oriented, but was before I learned JUnit. As of May 19th, the test cases
that I have formally written and those that I remember specifically looking for have been added to the code itself, but
this app easily allows for people to create their own tests with no knowledge of JUnit. To do so, type in a word that you think should be good, or not, and hit the button. It will then read it by space. The algorithm itself is space sensitive, but
for mass testing, we have the activity as not.

Features that we've added:
(Some) Emoji Support,
(Some) Alternative character support,
Ability to interpret Swear words.
Ability to black-list words.

Features that should be added:
Ability to white-list words.

Features that need work:
Words to censor.
Effectiveness of censor and false positives.
